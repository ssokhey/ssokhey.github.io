After many failed attempts at blogging, today I finally commit myself to creating one, using Jekyll. As you can see, this is very minimal (note: not the Medium type of beautiful minimalistic design). I'll work on redesigning the blog using a more beautiful Jekyll template in some distant future. But this'll do. So expect to read my musings on random things: CS, programming, hackathons, my dream of being a software developer in Silicon Valley, college stuff, startup ideas, etc.
